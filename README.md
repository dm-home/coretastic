# Equivalent Soil Mass (ESM) Calculator

This repository now contains a static implementation of the Equivalent Soil Mass calculator. All calculations are performed in the browser using JavaScript so the site can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

Upload a CSV containing the columns below or experiment with the included `data/default_clean.csv` dataset.

| bd_i | soc_i | bd_n | soc_n | depth |
|------|-------|------|-------|-------|
| 1.5  | 0.014 | 1.1  | 0.016 | 30    |

Open `index.html` in a browser (or deploy the repository via GitHub Pages) to use the calculator. Both the fixed depth and profile based methods are implemented.
